   - Ensure the sum of all payments matches the total repayment amount.
   - Reject payments that exceed the remaining repayment amount.

7. **üìä Reporting and Insights**:
   - View detailed reports on loans, payments, and late fees.
   - Track the repayment status of each loan (e.g., fully repaid, partially repaid).

---

### **How It Works** üõ†Ô∏è

1. **üë§ Add Customers**:
   - Customers are added to the system with their basic information (e.g., name).

2. **üíº Create Loans**:
   - For each customer, a loan is created with details such as loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and start date.
   - The system calculates the **monthly payment** and **total repayment amount** automatically.

3. **üí∞ Record Payments**:
   - Borrowers make payments, which are recorded in the system.
   - Late fees are calculated dynamically based on the number of days overdue.

4. **üìÖ Generate Payment Schedules**:
   - Borrowers can view their payment schedules (monthly or yearly) to understand how much they need to pay each period.

5. **‚úÖ Track Repayment Status**:
   - The system tracks the remaining balance and ensures payments do not exceed the total repayment amount.
   - Once the loan is fully repaid, the system marks it as complete.

### **Example Workflow** üîÑ

1. **üë§ Add a Customer**:
   - Insert a new customer into the `Customers` table:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO Customers (BorrowerName) VALUES ('John Doe');
     ```

2. **üíº Create a Loan**:
   - Insert a new loan into the `MortgageLoans` table:
     ```sql
     DECLARE @LoanAmount DECIMAL(18, 2) = 250000.00;
     DECLARE @InterestRate DECIMAL(5, 2) = 3.75;
     DECLARE @LoanTerm INT = 30;
     DECLARE @TotalRepayment DECIMAL(18, 2);

     -- Calculate total repayment
     SET @TotalRepayment = @LoanAmount + (@LoanAmount * (@InterestRate / 100) * @LoanTerm);

     -- Insert the loan
     INSERT INTO MortgageLoans (CustomerID, LoanAmount, InterestRate, LoanTerm, StartDate, MonthlyPayment, DownPayment, TotalRepayment)
     VALUES (1, @LoanAmount, @InterestRate, @LoanTerm, '2023-01-01', 1157.79, 50000.00, @TotalRepayment);
     ```

3. **üí∞ Record a Payment**:
   - Use the `RecordPayment` stored procedure to record a payment:
     ```sql
     EXEC RecordPayment @LoanID = 1, @PaymentDate = '2023-01-01', @AmountPaid = 1157.79;
     ```

4. **üìÖ Generate a Payment Schedule**:
   - Use the `GetPaymentSchedule` stored procedure to generate a monthly or yearly schedule:
     ```sql
     EXEC GetPaymentSchedule @LoanID = 1, @ScheduleType = 'Monthly';
     ```

    CONSTRAINT FK_MortgageLoans_CustomerID FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
```

#### `LateFeeRules` Table
Defines dynamic late fee rules based on the number of days overdue.

```sql
CREATE TABLE LateFeeRules (
    RuleID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1), -- Unique identifier for each rule
    MinDaysOverdue INT NOT NULL,          -- Minimum days overdue for this rule
    MaxDaysOverdue INT NULL,              -- Maximum days overdue for this rule (NULL means no upper limit)

    CONSTRAINT FK_Payments_LoanID FOREIGN KEY (LoanID) REFERENCES MortgageLoans(LoanID)
);
```

---

### **Step 2: Insert Sample Data** üì•

#### Insert Data into `Customers`
```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (BorrowerName)
VALUES
('John Doe'),
('Jane Smith'),
('Alice Johnson'),
('Bob Brown');
```

#### Insert Data into `MortgageLoans`

DECLARE @LoanAmount DECIMAL(18, 2) = 250000.00;
DECLARE @InterestRate DECIMAL(5, 2) = 3.75;
DECLARE @LoanTerm INT = 30;
DECLARE @TotalRepayment DECIMAL(18, 2);

-- Calculate total repayment
SET @TotalRepayment = @LoanAmount + (@LoanAmount * (@InterestRate / 100) * @LoanTerm);

-- Insert the loan
INSERT INTO MortgageLoans (CustomerID, LoanAmount, InterestRate, LoanTerm, StartDate, MonthlyPayment, DownPayment, TotalRepayment)
VALUES (1, @LoanAmount, @InterestRate, @LoanTerm, '2023-01-01', 1157.79, 50000.00, @TotalRepayment);
```

(1, '2023-03-01', 1157.79, 0);       -- On-time payment
```

---

### **Step 3: Create Stored Procedures** ‚öôÔ∏è

#### 1. **RecordPayment**
Records a payment and calculates dynamic late fees.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE RecordPayment
    @LoanID INT,
    @PaymentDate DATE,
    @AmountPaid DECIMAL(18, 2)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @DueDate DATE;
    DECLARE @DaysOverdue INT;
    DECLARE @LateFee DECIMAL(18, 2) = 0;
    DECLARE @TotalRepayment DECIMAL(18, 2);
    DECLARE @TotalPaid DECIMAL(18, 2);

    -- Get the due date (e.g., 1st of every month)
    SET @DueDate = DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(@PaymentDate), MONTH(@PaymentDate), 1);

    -- Calculate days overdue
    SET @DaysOverdue = DATEDIFF(DAY, @DueDate, @PaymentDate);

    -- Calculate late fee dynamically based on rules
    IF @DaysOverdue > 0
    BEGIN
        SELECT @LateFee = LateFeeAmount
        FROM LateFeeRules
        WHERE @DaysOverdue >= MinDaysOverdue
          AND (@DaysOverdue <= MaxDaysOverdue OR MaxDaysOverdue IS NULL);
    END;

    -- Get the total repayment amount for the loan
    SELECT @TotalRepayment = TotalRepayment
    FROM MortgageLoans
    WHERE LoanID = @LoanID;

    -- Calculate the total amount paid so far
    SELECT @TotalPaid = ISNULL(SUM(AmountPaid), 0)
    FROM Payments
    WHERE LoanID = @LoanID;

    -- Check if the payment exceeds the remaining repayment amount
    IF (@TotalPaid + @AmountPaid) > @TotalRepayment
    BEGIN
        RAISERROR('Payment exceeds the total repayment amount.', 16, 1);
        RETURN;
    END;

    -- Insert the payment record
    INSERT INTO Payments (LoanID, PaymentDate, AmountPaid, LateFee)
    VALUES (@LoanID, @PaymentDate, @AmountPaid, @LateFee);

    -- Check if the loan is fully repaid
    IF (@TotalPaid + @AmountPaid) = @TotalRepayment
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Loan fully repaid!';
    END;
END;
```

#### 2. **GetPaymentSchedule**
Generates a monthly or yearly payment schedule.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetPaymentSchedule
    @LoanID INT,                     -- Loan ID to generate the schedule for
    @ScheduleType NVARCHAR(10)       -- 'Monthly' or 'Yearly'
AS
BEGIN
    -- Declare variables
    DECLARE @LoanAmount DECIMAL(18, 2);

    DECLARE @RemainingBalance DECIMAL(18, 2);
    DECLARE @PaymentDate DATE;
    DECLARE @Principal DECIMAL(18, 2);
    DECLARE @Interest DECIMAL(18, 2);
    DECLARE @TotalPayment DECIMAL(18, 2);
    DECLARE @Period INT = 1;

    -- Fetch loan details
    SELECT 
        @LoanAmount = LoanAmount,
        @InterestRate = InterestRate,
        @LoanTerm = LoanTerm,
        @MonthlyPayment = MonthlyPayment,
        @StartDate = StartDate,
        @TotalRepayment = TotalRepayment
    FROM MortgageLoans
    WHERE LoanID = @LoanID;

    -- Initialize remaining balance
    SET @RemainingBalance = @LoanAmount;

    -- Create a temporary table to store the schedule
    CREATE TABLE #PaymentSchedule (
        Period INT,
        PaymentDate DATE,
        Principal DECIMAL(18, 2),
        Interest DECIMAL(18, 2),
        TotalPayment DECIMAL(18, 2),
        RemainingBalance DECIMAL(18, 2)
    );

    -- Calculate monthly or yearly schedule
    WHILE @Period <= @LoanTerm * CASE WHEN @ScheduleType = 'Monthly' THEN 12 ELSE 1 END
    BEGIN
        -- Calculate payment date
        SET @PaymentDate = DATEADD(MONTH, @Period - 1, @StartDate);

        -- Calculate interest for the period
        SET @Interest = @RemainingBalance * (@InterestRate / 100) / CASE WHEN @ScheduleType = 'Monthly' THEN 12 ELSE 1 END;

        -- Calculate principal for the period
        SET @Principal = @MonthlyPayment - @Interest;

        -- Update remaining balance
        SET @RemainingBalance = @RemainingBalance - @Principal;

        -- Calculate total payment for the period
        SET @TotalPayment = @Principal + @Interest;

        -- Insert the period details into the temporary table
        INSERT INTO #PaymentSchedule (Period, PaymentDate, Principal, Interest, TotalPayment, RemainingBalance)
        VALUES (@Period, @PaymentDate, @Principal, @Interest, @TotalPayment, @RemainingBalance);

        -- Increment period
        SET @Period = @Period + 1;
    END;

    -- Return the payment schedule
    SELECT 
        Period,
        PaymentDate,
        Principal,
        Interest,
        TotalPayment,
        RemainingBalance
    FROM #PaymentSchedule
    ORDER BY Period;

    -- Drop the temporary table
    DROP TABLE #PaymentSchedule;
END;
